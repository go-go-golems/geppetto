# Improved JavaScript Conversation Bindings

Simplified the JavaScript conversation bindings by leveraging Goja's automatic struct mapping capabilities. This provides better type safety and reduces boilerplate code.

- Removed manual method bindings in RegisterConversation
- Changed method signatures to use native Go types instead of Goja-specific types
- Improved error handling by returning proper errors instead of panicking
- Methods now return promises in JavaScript for better async handling
