# Explanation of Step Publishing and Watermill in Geppetto

This document explains how the `steps.Step` abstraction in Geppetto, particularly AI-related steps, utilizes publishing mechanisms and the role the Watermill library plays in this process.

## 1. Publishing in `steps.Step`

The `steps.Step[T, U]` interface defines a method:

```go
AddPublishedTopic(publisher message.Publisher, topic string) error
```

*   **Purpose:** This method allows a `Step` instance to be configured with a `message.Publisher` and a specific `topic` string. The intention is for the step to publish messages (events) related to its execution lifecycle onto this topic using the provided publisher.
*   **Implementation:** Concrete step implementations (like `openai.ChatStep`, `claude.MessagesStep`, etc.) typically store the provided publisher and topic internally. Often, they use a helper like `events.PublisherManager` to manage multiple potential publisher/topic pairs.
*   **Usage:** Inside the `Start` method (the core execution logic of a step), the step uses the stored publisher to send messages at various points:
    *   **Start:** When the step begins processing.
    *   **Partial Results:** For streaming steps (like AI chat completion), messages indicating partial output delivery.
    *   **Final Result:** When the step completes successfully, often including the final output.
    *   **Errors:** If an error occurs during execution.
    *   **Interrupts:** If the step's context is canceled.
*   **Example (`openai.ChatStep`):** This step uses its internal `publisherManager` (configured via `AddPublishedTopic`) to publish events like `chat.NewStartEvent`, `chat.NewPartialCompletionEvent`, `chat.NewFinalEvent`, `chat.NewErrorEvent`, and `chat.NewInterruptEvent`. These events contain metadata about the step's execution, settings, and the content being processed or generated.

## 2. Role of Watermill

Watermill (`github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill`) is a Go library for building event-driven applications. It provides the core building blocks for message publishing and subscribing.

*   **Abstraction:** Watermill defines standard interfaces like `message.Publisher` and `message.Subscriber`. This decouples the application logic (like the Geppetto steps) from the specific message broker or transport mechanism (e.g., in-memory, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Google Cloud Pub/Sub).
*   **Publisher:** The `message.Publisher` interface (passed into `AddPublishedTopic`) is provided by Watermill. Geppetto steps use this interface to send their lifecycle events as `message.Message` objects.
*   **Message Broker:** Watermill handles the underlying communication. When a step calls `publisher.Publish(topic, message)`, Watermill takes care of routing that message to the appropriate broker configured for that topic.
*   **Decoupling:** By using Watermill, Geppetto steps don't need to know *how* messages are being sent or *who* is listening. They just need a `message.Publisher` instance. This makes the system flexible and allows different parts (like UI components, logging services, or other steps) to subscribe to step events without the step needing direct knowledge of them.

## Summary

In essence:

1.  The `steps.Step` interface includes `AddPublishedTopic` to enable steps to announce their progress and state.
2.  AI steps (and others) implement this by storing the provided Watermill `message.Publisher` and `topic`.
3.  During execution (`Start`), steps use the publisher to send lifecycle events (start, partial, final, error) as `message.Message` objects.
4.  Watermill provides the `message.Publisher` interface and handles the actual delivery of these messages over the configured transport, decoupling the steps from the subscribers and the underlying pub/sub infrastructure.
