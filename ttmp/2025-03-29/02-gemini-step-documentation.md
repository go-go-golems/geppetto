# Explanation of Step Pub/Sub Mechanism in Geppetto

This document explains how the `Step` abstraction in Geppetto, particularly AI steps, leverages the publisher/topic mechanism, and the role Watermill plays.

## The `Step` Interface and `AddPublishedTopic`

The core `Step` interface in `pkg/steps/step.go` defines the contract for individual processing units within Geppetto:

```go
// geppetto/pkg/steps/step.go
type Step[T any, U any] interface {
	// Start gets called multiple times for the same Step, once per incoming value,
	// since StepResult is also the list monad (ie., supports multiple values)
	Start(ctx context.Context, input T) (StepResult[U], error)
	// XXX this needs to be replaced as a step that creates a stream of PartialCompletionEvent etc...
	AddPublishedTopic(publisher message.Publisher, topic string) error
}
```

The key method for understanding the pub/sub integration is `AddPublishedTopic`. This method allows a `Step` instance to be configured with:

1.  A `message.Publisher`: This is an interface provided by the Watermill library, representing the capability to publish messages.
2.  A `topic`: A string identifying the destination channel or queue where messages should be sent.

By calling `AddPublishedTopic`, a step is essentially given the ability and destination to publish messages related to its execution. The comment `// XXX this needs to be replaced as a step that creates a stream of PartialCompletionEvent etc...` indicates that this mechanism is likely intended for publishing events *during* the step's execution, such as partial results or status updates, although the current implementation might be simpler.

## How Steps Leverage Publishing

A `Step`, once configured with a publisher and topic via `AddPublishedTopic`, can use the `publisher.Publish(topic, message)` method (from the Watermill library) internally within its `Start` method logic.

Here's how different steps, especially AI steps, might leverage this:

1.  **Intermediate Results / Streaming:** For AI steps involving interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) that support streaming (returning results token by token or chunk by chunk), the step could publish each chunk as a separate message to the configured topic. Downstream consumers could then listen to this topic to process the results incrementally. The `XXX` comment strongly suggests this is a primary intended use case.
2.  **Status Updates:** A step could publish messages indicating its current state (e.g., "Started processing", "API call initiated", "Parsing response", "Completed successfully", "Encountered error"). This provides observability into the workflow.
3.  **Final Results:** While the primary return mechanism is the `StepResult`, a step *could* also publish its final result(s) as messages. This might be useful for broadcasting results to multiple independent consumers who aren't directly part of the sequential step chain.
4.  **Events and Notifications:** Steps could publish specific events, like "Threshold exceeded" or "Pattern detected," which might trigger other processes or alerts elsewhere in the system.
5.  **Debugging and Logging:** Published messages can serve as a detailed, structured log stream for debugging complex sequences of steps.

## Role of Watermill

Watermill (`github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/watermill`) is the underlying library that provides the pub/sub messaging infrastructure. Geppetto uses Watermill's abstractions, primarily:

1.  `message.Publisher`: The interface used by steps to send messages.
2.  `message.Subscriber`: (Implicitly used elsewhere in Geppetto, likely where steps are orchestrated or workflows are defined) The interface used to receive messages.
3.  `message.Message`: The structure representing the data being sent, containing a payload and metadata.

Watermill handles the complexities of message passing. It provides adapters for various messaging systems (like Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, or even simple in-memory channels for testing). This means Geppetto's core step logic doesn't need to know the specifics of the underlying message broker; it just interacts with the Watermill `Publisher` interface.

In essence, Watermill acts as the message bus or backbone, enabling decoupling between steps and allowing for event-driven communication patterns within Geppetto workflows. The `AddPublishedTopic` mechanism hooks individual steps into this broader messaging system.
