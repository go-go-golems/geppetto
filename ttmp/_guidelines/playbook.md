# Guidelines: Playbook Documents

## Purpose
Playbooks document command sequences, manual test procedures, or operational steps. They're designed for repeated execution.

## Required Elements
- **Purpose**: What the playbook accomplishes
- **Environment Assumptions**: Required setup
- **Commands**: The actual command sequence
- **Exit Criteria**: Success indicators

## Best Practices
- List all prerequisites upfront
- Use code blocks for commands
- Include expected outputs
- Document failure modes
- Update when commands change
- Keep environment assumptions explicit
- Include timing estimates if relevant
