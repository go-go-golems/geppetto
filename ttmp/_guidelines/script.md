# Guidelines: Script Documents

## Purpose
Script documents describe temporary code, SQL snippets, or REPL transcripts. They live in the scripts/ directory alongside executable files.

## Required Elements
- **Purpose**: What the script does
- **Usage**: How to run it
- **Implementation**: Description or link to executable

## Best Practices
- Keep scripts focused on a single purpose
- Document all required parameters
- Include usage examples
- Note any side effects or dependencies
- Link to related design docs if applicable
- Archive when no longer needed
- Include a README.md in scripts/ summarizing all scripts
