# Guidelines: Reference Documents

## Purpose
Reference documents provide copy/paste-ready context, API contracts, prompt packs, or quick-look tables. They're designed for reuse in LLM prompts or as quick reference during development.

## Required Elements
- **Goal**: What this reference accomplishes
- **Context**: Background needed to use the reference
- **Quick Reference**: The actual reference content (code, tables, prompts)
- **Usage Examples**: How to use this reference

## Best Practices
- Focus on copy/paste-ready content
- Keep context minimal but sufficient
- Format for easy scanning (tables, code blocks)
- Include practical examples
- Update when APIs or processes change
- Link to related references or design docs
