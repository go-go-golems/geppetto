# Guidelines: Design Documents

## Purpose
Design documents provide structured rationale and architecture notes. They document decisions, alternatives considered, and implementation plans.

## Required Elements
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview
- **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the problem
- **Proposed Solution**: Detailed solution description
- **Design Decisions**: Key decisions with rationale
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches evaluated
- **Implementation Plan**: Steps to implement

## Best Practices
- Start with executive summary for quick scanning
- Document the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- Include diagrams or code examples where helpful
- Keep open questions visible until resolved
- Link to related RFCs, tickets, or references
- Use clear section hierarchy for easy navigation
