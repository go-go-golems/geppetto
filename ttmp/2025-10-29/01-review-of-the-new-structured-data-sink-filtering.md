# Technical Review: FilteringSink Structured Data Extraction Feature

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Reviewer**: Technical Architecture Team  
**Scope**: `geppetto/pkg/events/structuredsink/filtering_sink.go` and associated design  
**Status**: Post-implementation review

---

## Executive Summary

The FilteringSink feature implements event-level middleware for extracting structured data blocks from LLM streaming text responses. While the feature successfully achieves its core goal of filtering inline YAML blocks and emitting typed events, the implementation reveals significant complexity, performance concerns, and incomplete error handling that warrant attention before broader adoption.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Core functionality works and is architecturally sound
- ⚠️ State management complexity exceeds initial design expectations
- ⚠️ Performance characteristics may not scale under load
- ❌ Error handling and edge cases are incomplete
- ❌ Documentation and examples insufficient for extractor implementors

**Recommendation**: The feature should undergo targeted refactoring to address state complexity, performance bottlenecks, and error handling before being promoted as a stable API.

---

## 1. Feature Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The FilteringSink enables LLM applications to emit structured data (citations, plans, queries, etc.) embedded within streaming text responses without showing these data blocks to end users. The system:

1. Monitors streaming text for tagged blocks: `<$name:type>` ```yaml ... ``` `</$name:type>`
2. Filters these blocks from the user-visible text stream
3. Emits strongly-typed events for downstream processing
4. Maintains consistency across partial and final completion events

### 1.2 Architecture

The implementation uses a wrapping `EventSink` pattern:
- Sits between event producers (engines) and consumers (routers)
- Maintains per-stream state keyed by message ID
- Delegates to pluggable `Extractor` implementations for typed event generation
- Forwards filtered text events alongside extractor-generated events

### 1.3 Design Alignment

The implementation closely follows the design document (`01-analysis-and-design-brainstorm...md`) with some notable deviations:
- Performance throttling (mentioned in design) is not implemented
- Error handling is partial compared to design specifications
- Context lifecycle management is more complex than initially specified

---

## 2. Complexity Analysis

### 2.1 State Machine Complexity

**Issue**: The `streamState` struct manages 18+ fields including 5 boolean flags, 6 string builders, and nested context pairs.

**Fields Breakdown:**
```
Core identity: id (1)
Context management: ctx, cancel, itemCtx, itemCancel (4)
Accumulation buffers: rawSeen, filteredCompletion, yamlBuf (3)
Boundary detection: carry (1)
Capture state: capturing, name, dtype, seq, session (5)
Sub-state buffers: openTagBuf, fenceBuf, closeTagBuf (3)
State flags: inFence, fenceOpened, fenceLangOK, awaitingCloseTag (4)
```

**Impact:**
- High cognitive load for maintainers
- Difficult to reason about all state transitions
- Error-prone when adding new features
- Testing surface area is large

**Root Cause**: Character-by-character streaming processing with look-ahead/look-behind requirements forces buffering at multiple stages (tag detection, fence detection, close tag detection).

### 2.2 Control Flow Complexity

The main processing loop (`scanAndFilter`, lines 294-430) contains:
- Nested conditionals up to 3-4 levels deep
- Multiple early `continue` statements (8 occurrences)
- State transitions scattered across conditionals
- Mixed concerns (parsing, buffering, event emission)

**Cyclomatic Complexity Estimate**: >15 for `scanAndFilter` alone, indicating difficult-to-test code.

### 2.3 Complexity Drivers

1. **Streaming Nature**: Must handle patterns split across token boundaries
2. **Dual Consistency**: Maintain both filtered text and original metadata
3. **Incremental Parsing**: Support both raw deltas and parsed snapshots
4. **Multiple Extractors**: Per-type session management with lifecycle tracking

**Assessment**: Complexity is inherent to the problem space but could be better encapsulated through internal decomposition.

---

## 3. Performance Analysis

### 3.1 YAML Parsing Overhead

**Critical Issue**: Lines 390-392 invoke `parseYAML(st.yamlBuf.String())` on every character received while in fence mode when `EmitParsedSnapshots=true`.

**Cost Breakdown:**
```
Per-character operations:
1. st.yamlBuf.String() - allocates new string from builder
2. yaml.Unmarshal([]byte(s), &v) - full YAML parse attempt
3. Most attempts fail (incomplete YAML) until final character arrives
```

**Scaling Example:**
- 100-byte YAML block streaming at 10 chars/sec = 100 parse attempts
- 10 concurrent streams = 1,000 parses/sec
- Each parse on incomplete YAML: ~100μs-1ms
- Total CPU: 100ms-1s per block (10-100% of one core)

**Design vs Implementation Gap**: Design document (line 257) explicitly suggests "throttle snapshot parsing (e.g., only on newline boundaries or every N bytes)" but this is **not implemented**.

### 3.2 String Allocation Pressure

Multiple sources of allocations per delta:
- `st.yamlBuf.String()` on each parse attempt (line 391)
- `st.openTagBuf.String()` on each tag detection check (line 307, 335)
- `st.closeTagBuf.String()` on each close tag check (line 400)
- Regex matching allocations (`reOpen.FindStringSubmatch`, line 493)

**GC Impact**: For high-throughput applications, this could trigger frequent garbage collections.

### 3.3 Recommendations

**High Priority:**
1. Implement parse throttling: only attempt parse on newline boundaries or every N bytes
2. Add parse timeout or complexity limit to prevent pathological YAML DoS
3. Consider lazy string conversion (work with byte slices until necessary)

**Medium Priority:**
4. Profile and optimize hot paths with actual streaming workloads
5. Add `MaxCaptureBytes` enforcement (declared in Options but not checked)
6. Consider object pooling for frequently allocated buffers

---

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

### 4.1 Incomplete Error Coverage

**Identified Gaps:**

1. **Unclosed Tags on Stream End** (Critical)
   - Lines 244-289 (`handleFinal`) process remaining text but don't check `st.capturing` state
   - If stream ends while `capturing=true`, no error event is emitted
   - `deleteState` (line 261) silently drops the incomplete capture
   - Item context gets cancelled (line 169) with no completion callback

2. **Malformed Handling Scope** (High)
   - `flushMalformed` only called from one location (line 356)
   - Covers: fence timeout/absence
   - Doesn't cover: invalid close tag, unclosed blocks, oversized captures

3. **Context Cancellation Race** (Medium)
   - Line 169-170: cancels item context during cleanup
   - No guarantee extractor has finished processing prior events
   - Could interrupt in-flight work (database writes, API calls, etc.)

4. **Buffer Overflow** (Low but Security-Relevant)
   - `MaxCaptureBytes` option exists but is never checked
   - Malicious/broken LLM could cause unbounded buffer growth
   - `yamlBuf`, `openTagBuf`, etc. grow without limit

### 4.2 Error Policy Inconsistency

Three error strategies defined:
- `ignore`: Drop malformed content silently
- `forward-raw`: Pass unfiltered text through
- `error-events`: Emit error via extractor session

**Issues:**
- Only applied to one failure mode (missing fence)
- Not applied to unclosed streams, parse errors, or other failures
- No documentation on when each strategy is appropriate
- Extractors must implement their own error event schemas

### 4.3 Recommendations

**Immediate:**
1. Add `st.capturing` check to `handleFinal` - emit error completion if true
2. Implement `MaxCaptureBytes` enforcement with clear error handling
3. Document guarantees about completion callback timing relative to context cancellation

**Short-term:**
4. Extend `OnMalformed` policy to cover all failure modes consistently
5. Add structured error types (not just `errors.New("malformed structured block")`)
6. Consider grace period before context cancellation to allow cleanup

---

## 5. API Design and Usability

### 5.1 Extractor Interface

**Current Design:**
```go
type ExtractorSession interface {
    OnStart(ctx context.Context) []events.Event
    OnDelta(ctx context.Context, raw string) []events.Event
    OnUpdate(ctx context.Context, snapshot map[string]any, parseErr error) []events.Event
    OnCompleted(ctx context.Context, final map[string]any, success bool, err error) []events.Event
}
```

**Strengths:**
- Clear lifecycle stages
- Flexible event emission (return multiple events)
- Strongly typed event support via registry

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Mandatory Implementation**: All four methods required even if unused
2. **Implementation Complexity**: Implementors must:
   - Understand streaming semantics (when each method fires)
   - Manually construct Event objects with proper metadata
   - Handle partial YAML states in `OnUpdate`
   - Reconcile `parseErr` with their own validation logic
3. **Context Usage Unclear**: Example in `main.go` ignores all context parameters
4. **No Base Implementation**: No helper/adapter to simplify common cases

### 5.2 Metadata Propagation

**Issue**: Lines 175-193 (`publishAll`) manually copy metadata fields:
```go
if impl.Metadata_.ID == uuid.Nil {
    impl.Metadata_.ID = meta.ID
}
if impl.Metadata_.RunID == "" { impl.Metadata_.RunID = meta.RunID }
if impl.Metadata_.TurnID == "" { impl.Metadata_.TurnID = meta.TurnID }
```

**Problems:**
- Extractor implementors must know to leave metadata zero-valued
- Fragile: easy to forget or override incorrectly
- Mixed responsibility (extractor creates event, sink fixes metadata)

### 5.3 Context Lifecycle

**Design Decision**: Two-tier contexts (stream + item)
- Stream context: lives for entire message stream
- Item context: per-structured-block, cancelled on completion

**Issues:**
1. **Implicit Behavior**: Documentation doesn't explain two-tier model
2. **Cancellation Timing**: Item context cancelled immediately after `OnCompleted` returns
3. **Goroutine Safety**: If extractor spawns goroutines from item context, they may be abruptly cancelled
4. **Testing**: No clear guidance on testing extractors with realistic context behavior

### 5.4 Recommendations

**API Improvements:**
1. Provide `BaseExtractorSession` helper with no-op defaults
2. Add factory helpers for common patterns:
   ```go
   func SimpleFinalExtractor(fn func(map[string]any) []events.Event) Extractor
   ```
3. Auto-propagate metadata internally (don't require zero values)
4. Add `BeforeComplete(ctx) error` callback for cleanup before cancellation

**Documentation:**
5. Comprehensive extractor guide with:
   - When each callback fires
   - Context lifetime guarantees
   - Error handling patterns
   - Testing strategies
6. Multiple example extractors (simple, streaming, with goroutines)

---

## 6. Testing and Observability

### 6.1 Current Testing State

Based on code analysis:
- Unit test file not present in provided materials
- Example in `cmd/examples/citations-event-stream/main.go` is 540 lines
- Example focuses on happy path demonstration

### 6.2 Testing Challenges

**Complexity Drivers:**
1. **Stateful Streaming**: Must simulate token-by-token delivery
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Split tags/fences across multiple deltas
3. **Timing Sensitivity**: Order and timing of events matters
4. **Context Interaction**: Cancellation and lifecycle behaviors

**Hard-to-Test Scenarios:**
- Tag split across 3+ deltas
- Multiple concurrent streams with shared sink
- Malformed input variations (12+ distinct cases)
- Race conditions in context cancellation
- Memory/performance under load

### 6.3 Observability

**Current State:**
- Debug logging available via `opts.Debug` (line 223, 256, 277)
- Logs message ID, event type, and delta content
- No metrics, no tracing integration

**Gaps:**
- No visibility into state machine transitions
- No buffer size/growth metrics
- No parse attempt/success/failure counters
- No timing information (how long in each state)
- No context cancellation logging

### 6.4 Recommendations

**Testing:**
1. Add comprehensive unit tests covering:
   - Each state transition
   - Boundary splits (tag, fence, close)
   - All error paths and `OnMalformed` modes
   - Multiple blocks per stream
   - Concurrent stream isolation
2. Add property-based tests for streaming invariants:
   - Filtered output + captured YAML = original input
   - Event ordering guarantees
   - Metadata consistency
3. Add benchmark tests for:
   - Parse overhead (chars/sec sustainable)
   - Memory allocation per block
   - Concurrent stream capacity

**Observability:**
4. Add structured logging with:
   - State transitions
   - Buffer sizes
   - Parse attempts/results
   - Session lifecycle events
5. Integrate OpenTelemetry tracing for event correlation
6. Add Prometheus metrics:
   - Active streams/sessions gauge
   - Parse attempts/failures counters
   - Processing latency histogram
   - Buffer size histogram

## 7. Security Considerations

### 7.1 Resource Exhaustion

**Vulnerability**: Unbounded buffer growth
- `MaxCaptureBytes` option exists but not enforced
- Malicious LLM output could grow buffers indefinitely
- Multiple concurrent attacks could exhaust memory

**Attack Scenario:**
```
<$attack:v1>
```yaml
[50MB of YAML without closing fence or tag]
```

Current behavior: Buffers grow until OOM or stream timeout.

### 7.2 Regex Complexity

**Concern**: Line 485 defines `reOpen = regexp.MustCompile(...)` at package level
- Single regex, relatively simple pattern
- Not vulnerable to ReDoS (no nested quantifiers)
- But executed on potentially attacker-controlled input

**Assessment**: Low risk currently, but pattern complexity could increase.

### 7.3 YAML Parsing

**Risk**: `yaml.Unmarshal` on untrusted input
- Known YAML bombs (recursive references)
- Golang yaml.v3 has mitigations but parsing is still CPU-intensive
- No timeout or complexity limit enforced

**Mitigation Status**: Partial
- `MaxCaptureBytes` (if enforced) limits input size
- No per-parse timeout
- No detection of abusive YAML structures

### 7.4 Recommendations

**Immediate:**
1. Enforce `MaxCaptureBytes` with clear error handling
2. Add per-buffer size limits (not just total)
3. Add timeout to YAML parse operations

**Short-term:**
4. Rate-limit parse attempts per stream (max N/sec)
5. Add YAML complexity detection (nesting depth, anchor count)
6. Consider sandboxing parse operations (separate goroutine with timeout)

**Long-term:**
7. Security audit by dedicated team
8. Fuzz testing with adversarial inputs

## 8. Strengths of the Implementation

Despite identified issues, the implementation has notable strengths:

### 8.1 Architectural Soundness

✅ **Clean Separation**: Sink wrapper pattern integrates with existing event system without engine modifications

✅ **Provider Agnostic**: Works with any engine that publishes `EventPartialCompletion` and `EventFinal`

✅ **Type Safety**: Strong typing preserved end-to-end via custom event registry

✅ **Composability**: Can be chained with other sinks in a pipeline

### 8.2 Streaming Correctness

✅ **Boundary Handling**: Correctly handles tags/fences split across deltas (via buffering)

✅ **Consistency**: Maintains consistency between `Delta` and `Completion` fields in forwarded events

✅ **Multiple Blocks**: Supports multiple structured blocks per stream via `seq` counter

### 8.3 Extensibility

✅ **Pluggable Extractors**: Clean registry-based approach for different data types

✅ **Per-Extractor Types**: Each extractor owns its event schema

✅ **Flexible Options**: Configurability via `Options` struct

### 8.4 Production Readiness (Partial)

✅ **Error Package**: Uses `github.com/pkg/errors` for wrapping

✅ **Logging**: Structured logging via zerolog

✅ **Context Propagation**: Proper context threading (though complex)

## 9. Comparative Analysis: Design vs Implementation

| Aspect | Design Doc | Implementation | Gap Analysis |
|--------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Complexity** | "Minimal implementation" | 550 lines, 18+ state fields | Significantly exceeded |
| **Performance** | "Throttle snapshot parsing" | Parse on every character | Not implemented |
| **Error Handling** | "OnMalformed controls all failure modes" | Partial coverage | Multiple gaps |
| **API Simplicity** | "Clean separation" | Manual metadata, no helpers | More complex than expected |
| **Context Model** | Mentioned briefly | Two-tier with cancellation | More complex than specified |
| **Testing** | "Add unit tests for fragmented tokens..." | Not evident | Missing |
| **Security** | "MaxCaptureBytes to avoid memory blowups" | Declared but not enforced | Critical gap |

**Conclusion**: Implementation complexity grew substantially beyond design expectations, primarily due to streaming boundary handling and state management requirements.

3. Offer migration tooling/guide
4. Maintain both for one release cycle

---

## 12. Conclusion

The FilteringSink feature represents a **solid architectural foundation** for streaming structured data extraction from LLM outputs. The core concept—wrapping event sinks to filter and transform text while emitting typed events—is sound and integrates well with Geppetto's existing event system.

However, the implementation reveals that **streaming text processing is inherently complex**, and this complexity has manifested in:
- Dense state management
- Performance characteristics that may not scale
- Incomplete error handling
- API usability challenges

**The feature works** and can be used successfully in controlled environments, but **should not be considered production-ready** without addressing the critical and high-priority recommendations.

### 12.1 Path Forward

Two strategic options:

**Option A: Incremental Improvement (Recommended)**
- Address critical issues in current architecture
- Improve testing, documentation, and observability
- Evolve API based on real-world usage feedback
- Timeline: 3-4 months to stable release

**Option B: Rearchitecture**
- Re-evaluate parsing approach (generator-based? FSM toolkit?)
- Simplify extractor interface significantly
- May require breaking changes
- Timeline: 6-8 months to stable release

**Recommendation**: Pursue **Option A** with commitment to address critical items. The current architecture can be successful with focused improvements. Reserve Option B if field experience reveals fundamental limitations.

### 12.2 Stakeholder Communication

**For Leadership:**
- Feature demonstrates innovation in LLM integration
- Needs investment in testing/hardening before broad deployment
- Timeline expectations should be calibrated

**For Product:**
- Feature enables new use cases (citations, plans, structured queries)
- User experience depends on filtering correctness
- Beta program recommended before general availability

**For Engineering:**
- Extractor API will evolve; early adopters should expect changes
- Comprehensive documentation coming soon
- Testing/observability improvements prioritized

**For Security:**
- Security review required before production deployment
- Resource exhaustion mitigations needed
- Untrusted LLM output should be considered adversarial input
