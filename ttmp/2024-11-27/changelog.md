# Steps Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation for the Steps system in Geppetto, explaining core concepts, event publishing, implementation patterns, and best practices.

- Created 05-steps-documentation.md with detailed explanation of Steps architecture
- Documented StepResult monad and metadata handling
- Added section on event types and publishing
- Included implementation examples and best practices

# Enhanced Steps Documentation

Expanded the Steps documentation with detailed implementation examples and practical usage patterns:

- Added concrete code examples for Step interface implementation
- Included detailed error handling patterns and best practices
- Added pipeline creation examples with proper error handling
- Enhanced event publishing documentation with real-world examples
- Added performance considerations for streaming operations 

# JavaScript Chat Step Factory Implementation

Added a JavaScript wrapper for the chat step factory to enable creating and managing chat steps in JavaScript environments. This implementation provides:

- JavaScript constructor for creating chat step factories
- Promise-based and callback-based APIs for chat operations
- Support for custom step options
- Comprehensive error handling
- Context cancellation support
- Full test coverage and documentation

# Refactored JavaScript Chat Step Factory

Refactored the JavaScript chat step factory implementation to use the common RegisterStep functionality:

- Unified the step registration process using the common RegisterStep method
- Improved conversation input/output conversion
- Added proper event loop integration for async operations
- Enhanced error handling and type safety
- Simplified the factory implementation by removing duplicate code
