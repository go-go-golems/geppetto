In **Disco Elysium**, “internal dialogue” isn’t just flavor monologue — it’s the *core UI and mechanics* of the RPG. Your character’s mind is split into **24 “skills”** (grouped under Intellect / Psyche / Physique / Motorics), and each skill speaks up like a distinct, unreliable character in your head. ([Disco Elysium Wiki][1])

## What the feature is, in practice

### 1) Your stats are *voices*, not numbers

Instead of “+2 to Perception” being an abstract modifier, it becomes:

* **Perception**: “Did you hear that? A floorboard creaked.”
* **Logic**: “That conclusion doesn’t follow.”
* **Inland Empire**: “The room feels… wrong. Like it remembers you.”
* **Electrochemistry**: “Smoke. Drink. *Now.*”
* **Volition**: “Ignore it. Stay on task.”

They argue, interrupt, tempt, reassure, catastrophize, rationalize, and occasionally *lie to you* (or at least interpret the world through their own bias). The player experience becomes: **you aren’t choosing actions as a single stable ‘self’ — you’re moderating a chaotic committee.**

### 2) The voices trigger mechanically in three big ways

#### A) Passive checks = automatic interjections

During dialogue and exploration, a skill can “ping” and butt in **without a dice roll**. If you’ve invested enough into that skill, you’ll get extra observations, warnings, hunches, or new dialogue options. (There are also “anti-passives” that only show up when you *don’t* meet a requirement.) ([discoelysium.fandom.com][2])

Mechanically, the game treats passives as a threshold test (skill + modifiers + a fixed value), which determines whether the voice speaks. ([discoelysium.fandom.com][2])

#### B) Active checks = you choose to attempt something risky

These are the classic “roll to succeed” moments, but they’re still framed as inner conflict: “Can you keep it together?” “Can you intimidate them?” “Can you see the pattern?”

Active checks are **2d6 + skill level + modifiers** versus a difficulty; meeting or beating it succeeds. Double-ones auto-fail; double-sixes auto-succeed. ([discoelysium.fandom.com][2])

They come in two types:

* **White checks**: can be retried later (often after changing something or spending a point). ([discoelysium.fandom.com][2])
* **Red checks**: one shot; success/failure becomes “canon” and pushes the story. ([discoelysium.fandom.com][2])

#### C) Thoughts you “internalize” = long-form inner dialogue

The **Thought Cabinet** is like taking one of those voices/ideas and letting it *reformat your personality* over time.

* You discover a thought (often from a conversation revelation or a weird epiphany).
* You slot it into the cabinet and **research** it for some in-game time, during which you get temporary effects.
* After completion, it becomes **internalized** with a lasting effect (and it often changes how you roleplay and what the narrator “feels like”). ([Disco Elysium Wiki][3])

## What makes it feel so distinct (design-wise)

### The game turns “builds” into *different narrators*

Two players can walk into the same room and hear radically different “reality”:

* A **high-Intellect** detective gets a running commentary of logic, trivia, reconstruction.
* A **high-Psyche** detective gets vibes, empathy reads, authority fantasies, paranoid spirals.
* A **high-Physique** detective experiences the body as a sensor: pain, fear, endurance, aggression, addiction.
* A **high-Motorics** detective gets micro-perception, reflex, composure, and “hands know how” competence.

So character building isn’t “what numbers do you want,” it’s “**which inner demons do you want loudest**?”

## Examples (made-up, but faithful to how the system behaves)

### Example 1: At a crime scene (passives firing)

You examine a broken window.

* **[Visual Calculus — passive]**: “Trajectory: inward. The shard pattern says it was struck from outside.”
* **[Logic — passive]**: “If the entry was forced, why is nothing stolen?”
* **[Encyclopedia — passive]**: “Cheap safety glass. Common in post-war renovations.”
* **[Inland Empire — passive]**: “Someone wanted it to *look* like a break-in. Like a little story they wrote for you.”
* **[Volition — passive]**: “Stay grounded. Verify before you spiral.”

Result: you get extra lines, maybe an extra dialogue option like *“This wasn’t random vandalism.”* That’s your “stats” **writing the investigation**.

### Example 2: Interrogation (skills arguing, you choose a line)

An NPC denies knowing the victim.

* **[Drama — passive]**: “They’re performing. Watch the hands. Too rehearsed.”
* **[Empathy — passive]**: “They’re scared — but not of you. Of what saying the truth will cause.”
* **[Authority — passive]**: “Crush them. Make the room smaller. Make them *submit*.”
* **[Suggestion — passive]**: “No. Soften your voice. Give them an escape route.”
* **[Half Light — passive]**: “Threat. Threat. *Show teeth.*”
* **[Composure — passive]**: “Your own expression is slipping. Don’t blink like that.”

Player-facing options might include:

1. **(Authority)** “You’re lying. Try again.” *(Active check possible)*
2. **(Suggestion)** “I’m not here to hurt you. Help me understand.”
3. **Stay silent** and let them fill the space.

The “internal dialogue feature” is that *the menu itself* feels like an argument you’re refereeing.

### Example 3: A temptation spiral (Electrochemistry vs Volition)

You spot booze, and your day is already a mess.

* **[Electrochemistry — passive]**: “There. A solution. Pour it in. Warmth, silence, relief.”
* **[Logic — passive]**: “Alcohol will reduce performance across multiple domains.”
* **[Physical Instrument — passive]**: “You can handle it. You’re strong. Don’t be weak.”
* **[Volition — passive]**: “Strength is not drinking. Strength is *not needing to*.”
* **[Endurance — passive]**: “Your body remembers. This will hurt later.”

If you click **Drink**, that might be an active moment with consequences — but crucially, it *feels* like losing a vote inside your own head.

### Example 4: A white check fail that becomes content (not just “you lose”)

You attempt a delicate social maneuver.

* You pick **(Rhetoric)** “Corner them with the contradiction.”
* **Active check fails (white)**.

Instead of “nope,” you get:

* **[Rhetoric]**: “You overplayed it — you sound like a pamphlet that learned to talk.”
* **[Empathy]**: “They’re annoyed, but also… amused. You can recover.”
* A new option appears: **Apologize and pivot**, or **double down**, or **change tactics**.

This is why people say Disco Elysium makes failure fun: the “internal dialogue” turns the miss into *characterization*.

If you want, tell me a “build” (e.g., high Psyche / low Intellect, or a specific signature skill), and I’ll write a longer mini-scene showing exactly how that internal dialogue would sound and what choices it would unlock.
