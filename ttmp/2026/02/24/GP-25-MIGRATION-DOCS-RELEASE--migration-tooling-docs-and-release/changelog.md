## 2026-02-24

- Re-scoped GP-25 to hard-cutover docs/release work only; removed legacy conversion-tooling deliverables from scope.
- Updated index, design plan, and task list to focus on:
  - registry-first canonical documentation,
  - profile CRUD and schema API contracts,
  - breaking-change communication and release gating.
- Explicitly documented that legacy migration command hardening is not part of this ticket.
