# Close old MO tickets (MO-003..006): status + relevance review

## Overview

This ticket consolidates a status/relevance review of the MO-003..MO-006 series (including both `MO-005-*` tickets). The goal is to stop carrying stale “active” tickets by:
- identifying which tasks are already done (even if not checked off),
- identifying remaining work and its priority,
- recommending whether to close or split each ticket,
- providing concrete `docmgr` closure commands.
