By default, when you make a request to the OpenAI API, we generate the model’s entire output 
before sending it back in a single HTTP response. When generating long outputs, waiting for a 
response can take time. Streaming responses lets you start printing or processing the beginning of 
the model’s output while it continues generating the full response.

This guide focuses on HTTP streaming (`stream=true`) over server-sent events (SSE). For persistent 
WebSocket transport with incremental inputs via `previous_response_id`, see [the Responses API 
WebSocket mode](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/websocket-mode).

## Enable streaming

To start streaming responses, set `stream=True` in your request to the Responses endpoint:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

stream = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5.5",
    input=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say 'double bubble bath' ten times fast.",
        },
    ],
    stream=True,
)

for event in stream:
    print(event)
```

The Responses API uses semantic events for streaming. Each event is typed with a predefined schema, 
so you can listen for events you care about.

For a full list of event types, see the [API reference for 
streaming](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming). Here are a 
few examples:

```python
type StreamingEvent =
    | ResponseCreatedEvent
    | ResponseInProgressEvent
    | ResponseFailedEvent
    | ResponseCompletedEvent
    | ResponseOutputItemAdded
    | ResponseOutputItemDone
    | ResponseContentPartAdded
    | ResponseContentPartDone
    | ResponseOutputTextDelta
    | ResponseOutputTextAnnotationAdded
    | ResponseTextDone
    | ResponseRefusalDelta
    | ResponseRefusalDone
    | ResponseFunctionCallArgumentsDelta
    | ResponseFunctionCallArgumentsDone
    | ResponseFileSearchCallInProgress
    | ResponseFileSearchCallSearching
    | ResponseFileSearchCallCompleted
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterInProgress
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterCallCodeDelta
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterCallCodeDone
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterCallInterpreting
    | ResponseCodeInterpreterCallCompleted
    | Error
```

## Read the responses

If you’re using our SDK, every event is a typed instance. You can also identity individual events 
using the `type` property of the event.

Some key lifecycle events are emitted only once, while others are emitted multiple times as the 
response is generated. Common events to listen for when streaming text are:

```plaintext
- \`response.created\`
- \`response.output_text.delta\`
- \`response.completed\`
- \`error\`
```

For a full list of events you can listen for, see the [API reference for 
streaming](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming).

## Advanced use cases

For more advanced use cases, like streaming tool calls, check out the following dedicated guides:

- [Streaming function 
calls](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/function-calling#streaming)
- [Streaming structured 
output](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/structured-outputs#streaming)

## Moderation risk

Note that streaming the model’s output in a production application makes it more difficult to 
moderate the content of the completions, as partial completions may be more difficult to evaluate. 
This may have implications for approved usage.

If you request [moderation scores with a generation 
request](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/moderation#moderate-generated-content), the 
scores arrive after the full generated output is available. They aren’t included with partial 
output deltas.
