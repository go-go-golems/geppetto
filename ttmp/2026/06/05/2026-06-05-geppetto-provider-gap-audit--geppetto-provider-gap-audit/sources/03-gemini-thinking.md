The [Gemini 3 and 2.5 series models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) use an internal 
"thinking process" that significantly improves their reasoning and multi-step planning abilities, 
making them highly effective for complex tasks such as coding, advanced mathematics, and data 
analysis.

This guide shows you how to work with Gemini's thinking capabilities using the Gemini API.

## Generating content with thinking

Initiating a request with a thinking model is similar to any other content generation request. The 
key difference lies in specifying one of the [models with thinking support](#supported-models) in 
the `model` field, as demonstrated in the following [text 
generation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/text-generation#text-input) example:

### Python

```
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()
prompt = "Explain the concept of Occam's Razor and provide a simple, everyday example."
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3.5-flash",
    contents=prompt
)

print(response.text)
```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const prompt = "Explain the concept of Occam's Razor and provide a simple, everyday example.";

  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
    contents: prompt,
  });

  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```

### Go

```
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "os"
  "google.golang.org/genai"
)

func main() {
  ctx := context.Background()
  client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
  }

  prompt := "Explain the concept of Occam's Razor and provide a simple, everyday example."
  model := "gemini-3.5-flash"

  resp, _ := client.Models.GenerateContent(ctx, model, genai.Text(prompt), nil)

  fmt.Println(resp.Text())
}
```

### REST

```
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-3.5-flash:generateContent" \
 -H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -X POST \
 -d '{
   "contents": [
     {
       "parts": [
         {
           "text": "Explain the concept of Occam'\''s Razor and provide a simple, everyday example."
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
 }'
 \`\`\`
```

## Thought summaries

Thought summaries are summarized versions of the model's raw thoughts and offer insights into the 
model's internal reasoning process. Note that thinking levels and budgets apply to the model's raw 
thoughts and not to thought summaries.

You can enable thought summaries by setting `includeThoughts` to `true` in your request 
configuration. You can then access the summary by iterating through the `response` parameter's 
`parts`, and checking the `thought` boolean.

Here's an example demonstrating how to enable and retrieve thought summaries without streaming, 
which returns a single, final thought summary with the response:

### Python

```
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
prompt = "What is the sum of the first 50 prime numbers?"
response = client.models.generate_content(
  model="gemini-3.5-flash",
  contents=prompt,
  config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
    thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(
      include_thoughts=True
    )
  )
)

for part in response.candidates[0].content.parts:
  if not part.text:
    continue
  if part.thought:
    print("Thought summary:")
    print(part.text)
    print()
  else:
    print("Answer:")
    print(part.text)
    print()
```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
    contents: "What is the sum of the first 50 prime numbers?",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        includeThoughts: true,
      },
    },
  });

  for (const part of response.candidates[0].content.parts) {
    if (!part.text) {
      continue;
    }
    else if (part.thought) {
      console.log("Thoughts summary:");
      console.log(part.text);
    }
    else {
      console.log("Answer:");
      console.log(part.text);
    }
  }
}

main();
```

### Go

```
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "google.golang.org/genai"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  ctx := context.Background()
  client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
  }

  contents := genai.Text("What is the sum of the first 50 prime numbers?")
  model := "gemini-3.5-flash"
  resp, _ := client.Models.GenerateContent(ctx, model, contents, &genai.GenerateContentConfig{
    ThinkingConfig: &genai.ThinkingConfig{
      IncludeThoughts: true,
    },
  })

  for _, part := range resp.Candidates[0].Content.Parts {
    if part.Text != "" {
      if part.Thought {
        fmt.Println("Thoughts Summary:")
        fmt.Println(part.Text)
      } else {
        fmt.Println("Answer:")
        fmt.Println(part.Text)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And here is an example using thinking with streaming, which returns rolling, incremental summaries 
during generation:

### Python

```
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

prompt = """
Alice, Bob, and Carol each live in a different house on the same street: red, green, and blue.
The person who lives in the red house owns a cat.
Bob does not live in the green house.
Carol owns a dog.
The green house is to the left of the red house.
Alice does not own a cat.
Who lives in each house, and what pet do they own?
"""

thoughts = ""
answer = ""

for chunk in client.models.generate_content_stream(
    model="gemini-3.5-flash",
    contents=prompt,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
      thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(
        include_thoughts=True
      )
    )
):
  for part in chunk.candidates[0].content.parts:
    if not part.text:
      continue
    elif part.thought:
      if not thoughts:
        print("Thoughts summary:")
      print(part.text)
      thoughts += part.text
    else:
      if not answer:
        print("Answer:")
      print(part.text)
      answer += part.text
```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

const prompt = \`Alice, Bob, and Carol each live in a different house on the same
street: red, green, and blue. The person who lives in the red house owns a cat.
Bob does not live in the green house. Carol owns a dog. The green house is to
the left of the red house. Alice does not own a cat. Who lives in each house,
and what pet do they own?\`;

let thoughts = "";
let answer = "";

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({
    model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
    contents: prompt,
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        includeThoughts: true,
      },
    },
  });

  for await (const chunk of response) {
    for (const part of chunk.candidates[0].content.parts) {
      if (!part.text) {
        continue;
      } else if (part.thought) {
        if (!thoughts) {
          console.log("Thoughts summary:");
        }
        console.log(part.text);
        thoughts = thoughts + part.text;
      } else {
        if (!answer) {
          console.log("Answer:");
        }
        console.log(part.text);
        answer = answer + part.text;
      }
    }
  }
}

await main();
```

### Go

```
package main

import (

  "google.golang.org/genai"
)

const prompt = \`

\`

func main() {

  if err != nil {

  }

  resp := client.Models.GenerateContentStream(ctx, model, contents, &genai.GenerateContentConfig{
    ThinkingConfig: &genai.ThinkingConfig{

    },
  })

  for chunk := range resp {
    for _, part := range chunk.Candidates[0].Content.Parts {
      if len(part.Text) == 0 {
        continue
      }

      if part.Thought {
        fmt.Printf("Thought: %s\n", part.Text)
      } else {
        fmt.Printf("Answer: %s\n", part.Text)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Controlling thinking

Gemini models engage in dynamic thinking by default, automatically adjusting the amount of 
reasoning effort based on the complexity of the user's request. However, if you have specific 
latency constraints or require the model to engage in deeper reasoning than usual, you can 
optionally use parameters to control thinking behavior.

### Thinking levels (Gemini 3)

The `thinkingLevel` parameter, recommended for Gemini 3 models and onwards, lets you control 
reasoning behavior.

The following table details the `thinkingLevel` settings for each model type:

| Thinking Level | Gemini 3.1 Pro | Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite | Gemini 3 Flash | Gemini 3.5 Flash | 
Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`minimal`** | Not supported | Supported (Default) | Supported | Supported | Matches the "no 
thinking" setting for most queries. The model may think very minimally for complex coding tasks. 
Minimizes latency for chat or high throughput applications. Note, `minimal` does not guarantee that 
thinking is off. |
| **`low`** | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported | Minimizes latency and cost. Best for 
simple instruction following, chat, or high-throughput applications. |
| **`medium`** | Supported | Supported | Supported | Supported (Default) | Balanced thinking for 
most tasks. |
| **`high`** | Supported (Default, Dynamic) | Supported (Dynamic) | Supported (Default, Dynamic) | 
Supported (Dynamic) | Maximizes reasoning depth. The model may take significantly longer to reach a 
first (non thinking) output token, but the output will be more carefully reasoned. |

The following example shows how to set the thinking level.

### Python

```
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model="gemini-3.5-flash",
    contents="Provide a list of 3 famous physicists and their key contributions",
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(thinking_level="low")
    ),
)

print(response.text)
```

### JavaScript

```
import { GoogleGenAI, ThinkingLevel } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-3.5-flash",
    contents: "Provide a list of 3 famous physicists and their key contributions",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingLevel: ThinkingLevel.LOW,
      },
    },
  });

  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```

### Go

```
package main

import (
  "context"
  "fmt"
  "google.golang.org/genai"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  ctx := context.Background()
  client, err := genai.NewClient(ctx, nil)
  if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
  }

  thinkingLevelVal := "low"

  contents := genai.Text("Provide a list of 3 famous physicists and their key contributions")
  model := "gemini-3.5-flash"
  resp, _ := client.Models.GenerateContent(ctx, model, contents, &genai.GenerateContentConfig{
    ThinkingConfig: &genai.ThinkingConfig{
      ThinkingLevel: &thinkingLevelVal,
    },
  })

fmt.Println(resp.Text())
}
```

### REST

```
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-3.5-flash:generateContent" \
-H "x-goog-api-key: $GEMINI_API_KEY" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-X POST \
-d '{
  "contents": [
    {
      "parts": [
        {
          "text": "Provide a list of 3 famous physicists and their key contributions"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "generationConfig": {
    "thinkingConfig": {
          "thinkingLevel": "low"
    }
  }
}'
```

You cannot disable thinking for Gemini 3.1 Pro. Gemini 3 Flash and Flash-Lite also do not support 
full thinking-off, but the `minimal` setting means the model likely will not think (though it still 
potentially can). If you don't specify a thinking level, Gemini will use the Gemini 3 models' 
default thinking level (e.g., `"high"` for Gemini 3.1 Pro, and `"medium"` for Gemini 3.5 Flash).

Gemini 2.5 series models don't support `thinkingLevel`; use `thinkingBudget` instead.

### Thinking budgets

The `thinkingBudget` parameter, introduced with the Gemini 2.5 series, guides the model on the 
specific number of thinking tokens to use for reasoning.

The following are `thinkingBudget` configuration details for each model type. You can disable 
thinking by setting `thinkingBudget` to 0. Setting the `thinkingBudget` to -1 turns on **dynamic 
thinking**, meaning the model will adjust the budget based on the complexity of the request.

| Model | Default setting   (Thinking budget is not set) | Range | Disable thinking | Turn on 
dynamic thinking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2.5 Pro** | Dynamic thinking | `128` to `32768` | N/A: Cannot disable thinking | 
`thinkingBudget = -1` (Default) |
| **2.5 Flash** | Dynamic thinking | `0` to `24576` | `thinkingBudget = 0` | `thinkingBudget = -1` 
(Default) |
| **2.5 Flash Preview** | Dynamic thinking | `0` to `24576` | `thinkingBudget = 0` | 
`thinkingBudget = -1` (Default) |
| **2.5 Flash Lite** | Model does not think | `512` to `24576` | `thinkingBudget = 0` | 
`thinkingBudget = -1` |
| **2.5 Flash Lite Preview** | Model does not think | `512` to `24576` | `thinkingBudget = 0` | 
`thinkingBudget = -1` |
| **Robotics-ER 1.6 Preview** | Dynamic thinking | `0` to `24576` | `thinkingBudget = 0` | 
`thinkingBudget = -1` (Default) |
| **2.5 Flash Live Native Audio Preview (09-2025)** | Dynamic thinking | `0` to `24576` | 
`thinkingBudget = 0` | `thinkingBudget = -1` (Default) |

### Python

    "thinkingConfig": {
          "thinkingBudget": 1024
    }
  }
}'
```

Depending on the prompt, the model might overflow or underflow the token budget.

## Thought signatures

The Gemini API is stateless, so the model treats every API request independently and doesn't have 
access to thought context from previous turns in multi-turn interactions.

In order to enable maintaining thought context across multi-turn interactions, Gemini returns 
thought signatures, which are encrypted representations of the model's internal thought process.

- **Gemini 2.5 models** return thought signatures when thinking is enabled and the request includes 
[function calling](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#thinking), specifically 
[function declarations](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#step-2).
- **Gemini 3 models** may return thought signatures for all types of 
[parts](https://ai.google.dev/api/caching#Part). We recommend you always pass all signatures back 
as received, but it's *required* for function calling signatures. Read the [Thought 
Signatures](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thought-signatures) page to learn more.

Other usage limitations to consider with function calling include:

- Signatures are returned from the model within other parts in the response, for example function 
calling or text parts. [Return the entire 
response](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#step-4) with all parts back to the 
model in subsequent turns.
- Don't concatenate parts with signatures together.
- Don't merge one part with a signature with another part without a signature.

## Pricing

When thinking is turned on, response pricing is the sum of output tokens and thinking tokens. You 
can get the total number of generated thinking tokens from the `thoughtsTokenCount` field.

### Python

```
# ...
print("Thoughts tokens:", response.usage_metadata.thoughts_token_count)
print("Output tokens:", response.usage_metadata.candidates_token_count)
```

### JavaScript

```
// ...
console.log(\`Thoughts tokens: ${response.usageMetadata.thoughtsTokenCount}\`);
console.log(\`Output tokens: ${response.usageMetadata.candidatesTokenCount}\`);
```

### Go

```
// ...
fmt.Println("Thoughts tokens:", response.UsageMetadata.ThoughtsTokenCount)
fmt.Println("Output tokens:", response.UsageMetadata.CandidatesTokenCount)
```

Thinking models generate full thoughts to improve the quality of the final response, and then 
output [summaries](#summaries) to provide insight into the thought process. So, pricing is based on 
the full thought tokens the model needs to generate to create a summary, despite only the summary 
being output from the API.

You can learn more about tokens in the [Token 
counting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/tokens) guide.

## Best practices

This section includes some guidance for using thinking models efficiently. As always, following our 
[prompting guidance and best practices](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies) 
will get you the best results.

### Debugging and steering

- **Review reasoning**: When you're not getting your expected response from the thinking models, it 
can help to carefully analyze Gemini's thought summaries. You can see how it broke down the task 
and arrived at its conclusion, and use that information to correct towards the right results.
- **Provide Guidance in Reasoning**: If you're hoping for a particularly lengthy output, you may 
want to provide guidance in your prompt to constrain the [amount of thinking](#set-budget) the 
model uses. This lets you reserve more of the token output for your response.

### Task complexity

- **Easy Tasks (Thinking could be OFF):** For straightforward requests where complex reasoning 
isn't required, such as fact retrieval or classification, thinking is not required. Examples 
include:
	- "Where was DeepMind founded?"
		- "Is this email asking for a meeting or just providing information?"
- **Medium Tasks (Default/Some Thinking):** Many common requests benefit from a degree of 
step-by-step processing or deeper understanding. Gemini can flexibly use thinking capability for 
tasks like:
	- Analogize photosynthesis and growing up.
		- Compare and contrast electric cars and hybrid cars.
- **Hard Tasks (Maximum Thinking Capability):** For truly complex challenges, such as solving 
complex math problems or coding tasks, we recommend setting a high thinking budget. These types of 
tasks require the model to engage its full reasoning and planning capabilities, often involving 
many internal steps before providing an answer. Examples include:
	- Solve problem 1 in AIME 2025: Find the sum of all integer bases b > 9 for which 17 
<sub>b</sub> is a divisor of 97 <sub>b</sub>.
		- Write Python code for a web application that visualizes real-time stock market 
data, including user authentication. Make it as efficient as possible.

## Supported models, tools, and capabilities

Thinking features are supported on all 3 and 2.5 series models. You can find all model capabilities 
on the [model overview](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) page.

Thinking models work with all of Gemini's tools and capabilities. This allows the models to 
interact with external systems, execute code, or access real-time information, incorporating the 
results into their reasoning and final response.

You can try examples of using tools with thinking models in the \[Thinking cookbook\]\[Colab\].
