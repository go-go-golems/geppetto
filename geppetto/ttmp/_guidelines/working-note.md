# Guidelines: Working Notes

## Purpose
Working notes capture free-form logs, meeting summaries, research findings, or exploratory thoughts. They're ephemeral but help maintain context during active work.

## Required Elements
- **Summary**: Brief summary for LLM ingestion (at the top)
- **Notes**: The main content (free-form)
- **Decisions**: Any decisions made
- **Next Steps**: Follow-up actions

## Best Practices
- Always include a summary at the top
- Keep notes focused and organized
- Extract important decisions to changelog.md
- Mark resolved items clearly
- Use consistent date formatting
- Archive when ticket is complete
