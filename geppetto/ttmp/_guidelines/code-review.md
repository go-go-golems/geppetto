# Guidelines: Code Review Documents

## Purpose
Capture the outcome of code reviews with enough context that future readers can understand scope, findings, and decisions.

## Required Elements
- **Summary**: One-paragraph overview of what was reviewed and the conclusion
- **Context**: PRs, branches, features; links to tickets and references
- **Files Reviewed**: Key files and rationale (consider notes in RelatedFiles)
- **Findings**: Strengths and issues/risks
- **Decisions & Follow-ups**: Decisions made and action items

## Best Practices
- Link to PRs, commits, and related docs
- Keep findings concise; prefer bullet lists
- Capture actionable follow-ups with owners
- Use RelatedFiles with short notes to explain why files matter
- Update when follow-ups are completed
