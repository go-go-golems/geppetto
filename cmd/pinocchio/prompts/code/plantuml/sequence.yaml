      PlantUML sequence diagrams are a powerful tool for visualizing interactions between different entities or participants.
      They use a simple syntax to denote messages sent between participants (`->`),
      with optional features like dotted arrows (`-->`) for distinct visualization, and reverse arrows (`<-` or `<--`) for improved readability.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
      Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
      Alice <- Bob: Another authentication Response
      @enduml
      ```
        
      Participants can be declared using the `participant` keyword, allowing more control over their display order and visual representation. Different keywords like `actor`, `boundary`, `control`, etc., can be used to change the shape of the participant.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      participant Participant as Foo
      actor Actor as Foo1
      Foo -> Foo1 : To actor
      @enduml
      ```
        
        You can rename a participant using the `as` keyword and change the background color of an actor or participant.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      actor Bob #red
      participant Alice
      Alice->Bob: Authentication Request
      Bob->Alice: Authentication Response
      @enduml
      ```
        
      Messages can be sent to oneself and can be multiline using `\n`.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      Alice -> Alice: This is a signal to self.\nIt also demonstrates\nmultiline \ntext
      @enduml
      ```
        
      You can change the arrow style and color for better visualization.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      Bob ->x Alice
      Bob -[#red]> Alice : hello
      @enduml
      ```
        
      The `autonumber` keyword is used to automatically add an incrementing number to messages.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      autonumber
      Bob -> Alice : Authentication Request
      Bob <- Alice : Authentication Response
      @enduml
      ```
        
      You can add a title to the page and display headers and footers using `header` and `footer`.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      header Page Header
      footer Page %page% of %lastpage%
      title Example Title
      Alice -> Bob : message 1
      Alice -> Bob : message 2
      @enduml
      ```
        
      You can group messages together using keywords like `alt/else`, `opt`, `loop`, `par`, `break`, `critical`, and `group`.

      Example:
      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
      alt successful case
      Bob -> Alice: Authentication Accepted
      else some kind of failure
      Bob -> Alice: Authentication Failure
      end
      @enduml
      ```
        
      Notes can be added to messages or participants for additional information.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      Alice->Bob : hello
      note left: this is a first note
      Bob->Alice : ok
      note right: this is another note
      @enduml
      ```
        
      You can split a diagram using `==` separator to divide your diagram into logical steps.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      == Initialization ==
      Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
      Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
      == Repetition ==
      Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
      Alice <-- Bob: Another authentication Response
      @enduml
      ```
        
      You can use reference in a diagram, using the keyword `ref over`.

      ```plantuml
      @startuml
      participant Alice
      actor Bob
      ref over Alice, Bob : init
      Alice -> Bob : hello
      @enduml
      ```

system-prompt: |
  You are an experienced system architect with expertise in designing complex software systems and architectures.
  You have mastered modeling techniques like UML and are highly skilled at 
  creating clear PlantUML diagrams from code and specifications. 
  
  You have deep knowledge of software design patterns, 
  distributed systems, microservices, domain driven design and other architectural approaches.
  You can rapidly analyze code and specs to identify key components, relationships, flows and boundaries.
  
  Your PlantUML diagrams are exemplars of clarity, brevity and precision.
  They convey the essence of the architecture and design to stakeholders and developers.
  The structure is easy to understand, with minimal syntax and annotations.
  The diagrams aid development, troubleshooting and future maintenance.
  
  {{ .additional_system }}

prompt: |
  Given the {{.style}} diagram spec:

  {{.uml_spec}}

  Write a diagram for {{.topic}}, {{if .concise}}focusing on conciseness and legibility{{end}}:

  ```
  {{.input}}
  {{if .context}}
  {{.context}}
  {{end}}
  ```

  Only use plantuml constructs defined in the specification above.
  
  Before outputting the diagram:
  {{ if .list_sections }}
  - Make a list of the participants, their role and who they communicate with
  - Describe if messages can be grouped and why
  - If there are especially complex relationships or messages, describe why
  {{ end }}
  
  Don't create new function names. only use original variable and function names present in the given code.
  Be mindful of the arrow direction.
  For complex sequences and participants, add notes. Don't output notes for trivial or simple facts already present in the component name or relationships.
  Use short keyword sentences.
  
  {{ if .with_summary }}
  At the end, give a summary of the input, describing each participants and the messages sent.
  {{ end }}
  
  {{ .additional }}
