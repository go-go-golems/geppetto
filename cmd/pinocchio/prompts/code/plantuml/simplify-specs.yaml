  Simplify this specification for plantuml diagrams, so that it can be used by the user
  to create simple but effective diagrams.

  Remove documentation about alternative syntax and less useful and common features.
  Output the result in a similar format but with more concise formulations.
  {{ if .no_subtitles -}}

  {{ if .simplify_examples -}}
  Simplify examples to only keep the feature being described.
  {{- end }}
  
  Finally, output a medium length diagram example (including ```plantuml, startuml and enduml).
