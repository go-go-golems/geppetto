  ### Prompt

  Create a series of concise, clear bullet-point HOWTO guides with keyword sentences for developers on how to use {{ .functionality }} of the attached code. library. Each guide should include:

  - A brief introduction to {{ .functionality }}.
  - Step-by-step bullet-point instructions.
  - Code examples demonstrating {{ .functionality }}.
  - An explanation of edge cases and important considerations.

  Remember to leverage your autoregressive nature by first outlining the structure of your response and then providing the detailed content. Your instructions should be clear and easy to understand, avoiding technical jargon unless necessary. The goal is to assist developers in effectively using the library's features, with an emphasis on proper implementation and awareness of potential issues.

  ### Output Structure

  1. **Functionality Introduction:**
     - Provide a short description of the {{ .functionality }} functionality.

  2. **Step-by-Step Instructions:**
     - List the steps in bullet points.
     - Each step should be a clear, actionable item.

  3. **Code Example:**
     - List the different ways of using {{ .functionality }}, showcasing all the features.
     - Include code snippets that demonstrates each use of {{ .functionality }}.

  4. **Edge Cases and Considerations:**
     - Bullet-point any edge cases to be aware of.
     - List important considerations regarding {{ .functionality }}'s use.

  By following this structure, you will ensure that each guide is informative, consistent, and practical for developers seeking to understand and implement the library's features.

  {{ if .code -}}
  Here is the implementation of {{ .functionality }}:
  ---
  {{ range .code }}
  FILE: {{ .Path }}
  ```
  {{ .Content }}
  ```
  {{- end }}
  ---
  {{- end }}

  {{ if .code_examples }}
  Here are examples on how to use {{ .functionality }}:
  ---
  {{ range .code_examples }}
  FILE: {{ .Path }}
  ```
  {{ .Content }}
  ```
  {{- end }}
  ---
  {{- end }}

  {{ if .unit_tests }}
  Here are unit tests that use {{ .functionality }}:
  ---
  {{ range .unit_tests }}
  FILE: {{.Path}}
  ```
  {{ .Content }}
  ```
  {{- end }}
  ---
  {{- end }}


  {{ if .concise }}
  Give a concise answer, answer in a single sentence if possible, skip unnecessary explanations.
  {{- end }}{{ if .use_bullets }}
  Use bullet points in the answer.
  {{- end }}{{ if .use_keywords }}
  Use keywords in the answer, not full sentences.
  {{- end }}
  {{ if .bracket }}
  {{ template "context" . }}
  {{ end }}
