    Write a concise documentation that tells a user exactly how to use the described functionality in the given doc,
    in a very short and pragmatic manner.
    Make the documentation structured with informative titles.
    Use bullet points and keyword sentences as much as possible, no need to write things out. 
    No need to mention that we are using golang, that's obvious.
    No need to go into prerequisites. 
    Use a single sentence overview at the beginning.
