      ## Simple action

        Activities label starts with `:` and ends with `;`. Text formatting can be done using creole wiki syntax. They are implicitly linked in their definition order.
        
        @startuml
        :Hello world;
        :This is defined on
        several **lines**;
        @enduml
        
        ## Start/Stop/End
        
        You can use `start` and `stop` keywords to denote the beginning and the end of a diagram.
        
        @startuml
        start
        :Hello world;
        :This is defined on
        several **lines**;
        stop
        @enduml
        
        You can also use the `end` keyword.
        
        @startuml
        start
        :Hello world;
        :This is defined on
        several **lines**;
        end
        @enduml


      ## Conditional

      You can use `if`, `then` and `else` keywords to put tests in your diagram. Labels can be provided using parentheses. The 3 syntaxes are possible:

        -   `if (...) then (...)`

        @startuml
        
        start
        
        if (Graphviz installed?) then (yes)
        :process all\ndiagrams;
        else (no)
        :process only
        __sequence__ and __activity__ diagrams;
        endif
        
        stop
        
        @enduml


      -   `if (...) is (...) then`
        
        @startuml
        if (color?) is (&lt;color:red&gt;red) then
        :print red;
        else
        :print not red;
        @enduml


      -   `if (...) equals (...) then`
        
        @startuml
        if (counter?) equals (5) then
        :print 5;
        else
        :print not 5;
        @enduml



      ### Several tests (horizontal mode)

      You can use the `elseif` keyword to have several tests _(by default, it is the horizontal mode)_:

        @startuml
        start
        if (condition A) then (yes)
        :Text 1;
        elseif (condition B) then (yes)
        :Text 2;
        stop
        (no) elseif (condition C) then (yes)
        :Text 3;
        (no) elseif (condition D) then (yes)
        :Text 4;
        else (nothing)
        :Text else;
        endif
        stop
        @enduml


      ### Several tests (vertical mode)

      You can use the command `!pragma useVerticalIf on` to have the tests in vertical mode:

        @startuml
        !pragma useVerticalIf on
        start
        if (condition A) then (yes)
        :Text 1;
        elseif (condition B) then (yes)
        :Text 2;
        stop
        elseif (condition C) then (yes)
        :Text 3;
        elseif (condition D) then (yes)
        :Text 4;
        else (nothing)
        :Text else;
        endif
        stop
        @enduml
        
        
        
        ## Switch and case \[switch, case, endswitch\]
        
        You can use `switch`, `case` and `endswitch` keywords to put switch in your diagram. Labels can be provided using parentheses.
        
        @startuml
        start
        switch (test?)
        case ( condition A )
        :Text 1;
        case ( condition B )
        :Text 2;
        case ( condition C )
        :Text 3;
        case ( condition D )
        :Text 4;
        case ( condition E )
        :Text 5;
        endswitch
        stop
        @enduml
        
        
        ## Conditional with stop on an action \[kill, detach\]
        
        You can stop action on a if loop.
        
        @startuml
        if (condition?) then
        :error;
        stop
        endif
        #palegreen:action;
        @enduml


      But if you want to stop at the precise action, you can use the `kill` or `detach` keyword:

        -   `kill`

        @startuml
        if (condition?) then
        #pink:error;
        kill
        endif
        #palegreen:action;
        @enduml

      -   `detach`
        
        @startuml
        if (condition?) then
        #pink:error;
        detach
        endif
        #palegreen:action;
        @enduml
        
        
        ## Repeat loop
        
        You can use `repeat` and `repeatwhile` keywords to have repeat loops.
        
        @startuml
        
        start
        
        repeat
        :read data;
        :generate diagrams;
        repeat while (more data?) is (yes)
        -&gt;no;
        stop
        
        @enduml
        
        
        It is also possible to use a full action as `repeat` target and insert an action in the return path using the `backward` keyword.
        
        @startuml
        
        start
        
        repeat :foo as starting label;
        :read data;
        :generate diagrams;
        backward:This is backward;
        repeat while (more data?)
        
        stop
        
        @enduml
        
        
        ## Break on a repeat loop \[break\]
        
        You can use the `break` keyword after an action on a loop.
        
        @startuml
        start
        repeat
        :Test something;
        if (Something went wrong?) then (no)
        #palegreen:OK;
        break
        endif
        -&gt;NOK;
        :Alert "Error with long text";
        repeat while (Something went wrong with long text?) is (yes) not (no)
        -&gt;//merged step//;
        :Alert "Success";
        stop
        @enduml
        
        ## While loop
        
        You can use `while` and `endwhile` keywords to have repeat loops.
        
        @startuml
        
        start
        
        while (data available?)
        :read data;
        :generate diagrams;
        endwhile
        
        stop
        
        @enduml
        
        
        It is possible to provide a label after the `endwhile` keyword, or using the `is` keyword.
        
        @startuml
        while (check filesize ?) is (not empty)
        :read file;
        endwhile (empty)
        :close file;
        @enduml
        
        
        If you are using `detach` to form an infinite while loop, then you will want to also hide the partial arrow that results using `-[hidden]->`
        
        @startuml
        :Step 1;
        if (condition1) then
        while (loop forever)
        :Step 2;
        endwhile
        -[hidden]-&gt;
        detach
        else
        :end normally;
        stop
        endif
        @enduml
        
        
        ## Notes
        
        Text formatting can be done using creole wiki syntax. A note can be floating, using `floating` keyword.
        
        @startuml
        
        start
        :foo1;
      floating note left: This is a note
        :foo2;
        note right
        This note is on several
        //lines// and can
        contain &lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt;
        ====
        * Calling the method ""foo()"" is prohibited
        end note
        stop
        
        @enduml


      You can add note on backward activity:

        @startuml
        start
        repeat :Enter data;
        :Submit;
        backward :Warning;
      note right: Note
        repeat while (Valid?) is (No) not (Yes)
        stop
        @enduml

      ## Grouping or partition

      ### Group

      You can group activity together by defining group:

        @startuml
        start
        group Initialization
        :read config file;
        :init internal variable;
        end group
        group Running group
        :wait for user interaction;
        :print information;
        end group
        
        stop
        @enduml

      ### Partition

      You can group activity together by defining partition:

        @startuml
        start
        partition Initialization {
        :read config file;
        :init internal variable;
      }
        partition Running {
        :wait for user interaction;
        :print information;
      }

        stop
        @enduml

      It's also possible to change partition color:

        @startuml
        start
        partition #lightGreen "Input Interface" {
        :read config file;
        :init internal variable;
      }
        partition Running {
        :wait for user interaction;
        :print information;
      }
        stop
        @enduml
        
        @startuml
        start
        partition "[[http://plantuml.com partition_name]]" {
        :read doc. on [[http://plantuml.com plantuml_website]];
        :test diagram;
      }
        end
        @enduml
