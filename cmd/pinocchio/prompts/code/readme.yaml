system-prompt: |
  You are a seasoned software engineer and technical writer.
  You have a knack for creating clear and concise README files for Go projects.
  You understand the importance of providing a comprehensive overview of a project, its goals, features, and installation instructions.
  You are familiar with GitHub badges and how to adapt existing content to new projects.
  {{ .additional }}
prompt: |
  Create a nice README for the {{.project }} project, given a rough documentation write up.
  
  The README should contain github badges right after the title (we used {{ .project }} as an example here, which should be replace by the project name "{{.project}}):

  # glazed - Output structured data in a variety of formats

    ![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/go-go-golems/glazed)
    ![](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/go-go-golems/glazed/push.yml?branch=main)

  ---

    this is followed by an introductory overview that details what the project does and its goals.

  For example, here is the section for glazed, which would need to be adapter for the new project:

  ---
    Glazed is a library that makes it easy to output structured data.
      When programming, we have a rich understanding of the data we are working with,
      yet when we output it to the user, we are forced to use a flat, unstructured format.
      
      It tries to implement some of the ideas listed in
    [14 great tips to make amazing command line applications](https://dev.to/wesen/14-great-tips-to-make-amazing-cli-applications-3gp3).
      
      It is in early alpha, and will change. Contributions are welcome,
      but this project is going to be an experimental playground for a while,
      while I try to figure out what is possible and worth tackling.

  ---

  {{ if .with_features }}
    This is followed by a features section that highlights some of the possibilities of the project, if possible with actual execution example.
  The list of features should be a concise list of bullet points, as more extensive examples will follow further down.

  Here is what it looks like for glazed:

  ---

  With glazed, you can output object and table data in a rich variety of ways:

    - as human-readable tables

    ```
    + glaze json misc/test-data/1.json misc/test-data/2.json misc/test-data/3.json
    +-----+-----+------------+-----+-----+
    | a   | b   | c          | d.e | d.f |
    +-----+-----+------------+-----+-----+
    | 1   | 2   | [3 4 5]    | 6   | 7   |
    | 10  | 20  | [30 40 50] | 60  | 70  |
    | 100 | 200 | [300]      |     |     |
    +-----+-----+------------+-----+-----+
    ```

  - as CSV/TSV
    
    ```
    + glaze json misc/test-data/1.json misc/test-data/2.json misc/test-data/3.json --output csv
    a,b,c,d.e,d.f
    1,2,[3 4 5],6,7
    10,20,[30 40 50],60,70
    100,200,[300],,
    ```

  ...

  {{ end }}

  {{if .with_install}}
  Then, adapt the following template to the new project, here geppettto and pinocchio are the name of the project used as example:

  ---
  ### Installation

  To install the `pinocchio` command line tool with homebrew, run:

    ```bash
    brew tap go-go-golems/go-go-go
    brew install go-go-golems/go-go-go/pinocchio
    ```

  To install the `pinocchio` command using apt-get, run:

    ```bash
    echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/go-go-golems/ /" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/fury.list
    apt-get update
    apt-get install pinocchio
    ```

  To install using `yum`, run:

    ```bash
    echo "
    [fury]
    name=Gemfury Private Repo
    baseurl=https://yum.fury.io/go-go-golems/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    " >> /etc/yum.repos.d/fury.repo
  yum install pinocchio
  ```

  To install using `go get`, run:

  ```bash
  go get -u github.com/go-go-golems/geppetto/cmd/pinocchio
  ```

  Finally, install by downloading the binaries straight from [github](https://github.com/go-go-golems/geppetto/releases).

  ---
  {{ end }}
  
  Finally comes the actual detailed documentation.
  
  ---
  
  Ok, now that we have gone over the structure of the documentation, let's get on to our task.
  
  Output the documentation by making it detailed, interleaving explanations with examples. This is
  the most important section of the readme and should cover all the information given as input in the 
  rough documentation. Don't skip anything and make it as clear as possible. Be exhaustive. 
  Present all the details given in the input.
  
  Instead of outputting the examples from the input verbatim, use shorthand ("example of XXX").
  
  
  Write a README for the {{ .project }} project which has the following rough documentation:
  
  --- BEGIN ROUGH DOCUMENTATION
  {{ .documentation }}

  {{ .additional }}
  {{if .context}}{{ .context }}{{end}}
  
  --- END ROUGH DOCUMENTATION
  
  {{ if .with_presummarization }}
  Before outputting the README, make a list of all the features, code examples and other important points present in the input,
  as a YAML frontmatter. List every code example given in the input. It is very important to include the frontmatter.
  {{ end }}
