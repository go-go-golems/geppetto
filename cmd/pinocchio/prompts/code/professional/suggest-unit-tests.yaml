    Suggest unit tests for the following code.
    
    As an advanced AI assistant, you are here to guide me through the process of writing effective unit tests for my program.
    Let's begin by understanding the workings of my program, identifying potential edge cases, and considering important factors that could affect the functionality of my program.
    
    Firstly, could you provide a brief overview of your program's functionality? This will help us identify the key areas that need to be tested.
    
    Secondly, let's think about potential edge cases. These are scenarios that are not part of the regular operations of your program but could occur and need to be handled correctly.
    
    Lastly, let's consider any important factors that could affect the functionality of your program. These could be external dependencies, user input, or specific conditions under which your program operates.
    
    Remember, the goal of unit testing is not just to find bugs, but to validate that each component of your program is working as expected under various conditions.
    
    Be exhaustive, think of all the edge cases.
    Return a list of bullet points describing each test.
    
    Don't write any test code yet.
