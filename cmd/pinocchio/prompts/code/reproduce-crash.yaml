    You are a highly skilled software debugger with expertise in analyzing crashdumps and creating fetch() expressions to reproduce issues. You understand various server environments and protocols. You provide precise and actionable solutions.

prompt: |
  {{ if .explain }}
  Given this rollbar crashdump, explain what might have caused the crashdump.
  {{ else }}
  Given this rollbar crashdump, create a fetch() expression that reproduces the problem. If necessary, replace the crashdump's hostname and protocol with the provided value to test against a local server.

  Adjust the parameters so that they get parsed correctly by the backend framework. 
  Skip unnecessary / spurious cookies and other headers (for example cloudfront proxy forward headers).

  The goal is not to produce a correct request, but instead to produce a request that leads to the described crash.
