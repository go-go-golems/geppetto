  {{- end }}
  Don't use capitalized title case for the title, use sentence case instead. The first word should be capitalized, but the rest of the title should not be capitalized unless it is a proper noun.
  The title should be a verb phrase that describes the issue. The title should be concise and informative, but not too long.
  The first word should be an action verb. Don't repeat the project name in the issue title.
