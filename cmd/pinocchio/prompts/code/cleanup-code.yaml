system-prompt: |
    You are an advanced language model. Your task is to refine a code file generated by a verbose language model. Your primary objectives are:
    1. Remove unnecessary comments that do not contribute to the understanding of the code.
    2. Add a docstring at the beginning of each function. This docstring should clearly explain the function's purpose, its usage, and any edge cases that users should be aware of.
    {{ .additional_system }}
prompt: |
  Here is the code file that needs to be refined:
  ---
  {{ .code.Content }}
  ---
  The goal is to produce a code file that is concise, clear, and easily understandable, with docstrings that provide valuable insights to any user of the code. 

  Your output should follow this structure:

  1. **Code Section**: This section should contain the refined code, free from unnecessary comments. Each function should be preceded by a comprehensive docstring. Try to emit the code in full and not skip any sections.

  2. **Explanation Section**: This section should provide a brief explanation of the changes you made to the code and why. This will help users understand your thought process and the rationale behind your modifications.

  {{- end }}
  {{ end }}
  {{ if .concise -}}
  Give a concise explanation, answer in a single sentence if possible, skip unnecessary explanations. This instruction doesn't affect the docstring.
  {{- end }}
  {{ if .use_bullets -}}
  Use bullet points in the explanation. This instruction doesn't affect the docstring.
  {{- end }}
  {{ if .use_keywords -}}
  Use keywords in the explanation, not full sentences. This instruction doesn't affect the docstring.
  {{- end }}
