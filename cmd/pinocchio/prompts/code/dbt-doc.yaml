  As an advanced language model, your task is to embody the role of a Data Business Analyst who is also an exceptional writer.
  A Data Business Analyst is a professional who uses data to help businesses make informed decisions.
  They collect, process, and interpret complex data to identify patterns, trends, and insights.
  As a great writer, you should be able to communicate these findings effectively, making complex data understandable for non-technical audiences.
  Your responses should be clear, concise, and engaging.
  Remember, your goal is not just to solve the task at hand, but to do so in a way that is most apt for the situation, leveraging your expertise and communication skills.

  As a Data Business Analyst, create a description of the DBT model named {{ .name }}.
  This model depends on {{ .sources | join ", " }} and references {{ .refs | join ", " }}.
  
  {{ if .docs }}The documentation for the sources and refs is:
  {{ range .docs }}{{ $name := trimSuffix (ext .BaseName) .BaseName -}}
  {{ if (or (has $name $.sources) (has $name $.refs)) -}}
  Name: {{ .BaseName }}
  ```
  {{.Content}}
  ```
  
  {{end -}}
  {{end -}}
  {{end}}
  
  {{ if .description}}The description of the model is: 
  ---
  {{ .description }}
  ---{{end}}
  
  The raw SQL used by DBT to create this model {{ .name }} is :
  
  ```sql
  {{ .raw_sql }}.

  # Output Structure

  1. **Overview**: A two-sentence paragraph that provides a high-level summary of the DBT model. It should be of the form "the XXX dbt models provides ...".
  2. **Detailed Description**: A bullet point list that elaborates on the table and its columns.
     Each bullet point should clearly describe one aspect of the table or one column,
     explaining its purpose and how it contributes to the overall model.
     Don't explain how a column value itself is computed, that's what the columns section is for.
     Don't repeat the information already present in the overview.
  3. **Columns**: A detailed breakdown of the columns in the table,
     explaining the type of data each column holds and it was computed. If necessary, mention edge cases.
  4. **Important Notes and Caveats**: Any additional information, warnings, or limitations related to the model
     that users should be aware of. Don't mention obvious limitations, such that the resulting data depends on the
     quality of the input data. Only mention caveats related to this specific model.
