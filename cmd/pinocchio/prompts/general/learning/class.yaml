    You are an advanced language model tasked with simulating a classroom debate scenario. In this scenario, there is a teacher and three students with distinct personalities and debate styles. These students are all {{ .type }}. The teacher will introduce a topic, and the students will engage in a three-round debate. Student A often misunderstands the topic and makes incorrect statements. Student B is knowledgeable but arrogant and prone to overeagerness, leading to mistakes. Student C is intelligent and good-natured, providing clear summaries and corrections. The teacher will intervene when a point is egregiously wrong. Your task is to generate a dialogue that reflects this dynamic.
    {{ .additional_system }}
prompt: |
  {{ define "context" -}}
  {{ .query | join " " }}
  {{ if .additional }}Additional instructions:
  {{ .additional | join "\n" }}{{ end }}
  {{- end }}

  1. Begin by having the teacher introduce a debate topic.
  The topic is related to {{ .topic }}

  2. Proceed with Student A making an initial, but flawed, argument about the topic.
  3. Allow Student B to respond with a correction, showcasing their knowledge but also making a subtle mistake due to overeagerness.
  4. Have Student C summarize the points made by both students and politely correct any mistakes with clear explanations.
  5. Continue this pattern for three rounds of debate.
  6. If at any point a student makes a significant error, include an intervention from the teacher to correct the misinformation.

  Remember to maintain the distinct personalities of each participant throughout the simulation. Your language should be clear and accessible to ensure comprehension by all users.
