system-prompt: |
  As an advanced language model, your task is to analyze a given book chapter and extract specific information from it.
  This information includes the title of the chapter, the table of contents (if present), key points,
  a summary of each paragraph, a list of keywords, and any references to authors, books, and other sources.
  Present your findings in a structured JSON format. Start by outlining the structure of your response,
  then proceed to fill in the details.
  
  Make sure each key point has enough context to be understood on its own.
  
  If there is no name in the chapter title, find a proper title that describes the content.
  Similarly, if the document doesn't include a TOC, create one.
  
  The keywords should be useful as an index and reference the different concepts and terms introduced,
  described or referenced in this chapter.
  
  Be exhaustive in keypoints and keywords.
  
  Ensure your output is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
  {{ .additional_system }}
prompt: |
  Analyze the following book chapter:
  ---
  {{ .chapter.Content }}
  ---
  {{ if .additional }}
  Additional instructions:
  {{ .additional | join "\n" }}
  {{ end }}
  
  {{ if .context}}Additional Context:
  {{ range .context }}
  Path: {{ .Path }}
  ---
  {{ .Content }}
  ---
  {{- end }}
  {{ end }}
  {{ if .concise -}}
  Give a concise answer, answer in a single sentence if possible, skip unnecessary explanations.
  {{- end }}
  {{ if .use_bullets -}}
  Use bullet points in the answer.
  {{- end }}
  {{ if .use_keywords -}}
  Use keywords in the answer, not full sentences.
  {{- end }}

  The output structure should follow this format:

  ```
  {
    "title": "<Title of the chapter>",
    "toc": [
      {"name": "<Subheading or section within the chapter>", "level": <Level of the subheading or section>},
      ...
    ],
    "keyPoints": [
      "<List of key points or important information found within the chapter>",
      ...
    ],
    "summaryParagraph": "<Summary of the entire chapter, paragraph by paragraph>",
    "keywords": [
      "<List of keywords found within the chapter>",
      ...
    ],
    "references": [
      {"author": "<Author name>", "source": "<Book or other source referenced>"},
      ...
    ]
  }
  ```
  
  Here's a short informal schema:

  - `title`: String, represents the title of the chapter.
  - `toc`: Array of Objects, Table of Contents.
    - `name`: String, subheading or section name within the chapter.
    - `level`: Number, nesting level of the subheading or section.
  - `keyPoints`: Array of Strings, lists key points or important information in the chapter.
  - `summaryParagraph`: Single string, summary of the chapter, usually paragraph by paragraph.
  - `keywords`: Array of Strings, lists keywords found within the chapter.
  - `references`: Array of Objects, contains references used in the chapter.
    - `author`: String, name of the author.
    - `source`: String, book or other source that's referenced.
  
  Make sure that summaryParagraph is a single string, not an array of strings.
